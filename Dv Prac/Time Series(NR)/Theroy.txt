Time series is a statistical concept that involves analyzing and modeling data points collected over time. In a time series, data points are indexed in chronological order, and the relationship between data points is often dependent on their temporal proximity. Time series data is commonly found in various fields such as economics, finance, weather forecasting, and social sciences, among others.

Time series analysis involves understanding the patterns and trends in the data and developing models to forecast future values. Common techniques used in time series analysis include trend analysis, seasonal analysis, and autocorrelation analysis. Trend analysis helps to identify the general direction of the data over time, while seasonal analysis helps to identify cyclical patterns that repeat over a specific period. Autocorrelation analysis involves examining the relationship between observations at different points in time.

Time series analysis can provide valuable insights into patterns and trends in data over time and can be used to make informed decisions based on forecasted values. It is an important tool for forecasting future values and understanding the impact of past events on the data.
