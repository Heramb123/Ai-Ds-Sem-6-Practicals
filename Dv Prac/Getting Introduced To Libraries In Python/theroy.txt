
Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library for Python that provides a variety of visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms. It allows for extensive customization of plots and is a good choice for creating publication-quality figures.

Plotly is a web-based data visualization library that provides interactive and dynamic visualizations. It offers a wide range of charts and graphs, including scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more. Plotly can be used with various programming languages, including Python, R, and JavaScript.

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. It offers several types of visualizations such as heatmaps, violin plots, and categorical plots, and provides easy-to-use functions for customizing plots with colors, styles, and themes.


Histogram: A graphical representation of data distribution, where data is divided into bins or intervals and plotted as bars whose heights indicate the frequency of observations falling within each bin.

3D Scatter Plot: A plot that represents the distribution of three variables using a set of points in a 3D coordinate system, where each axis represents one of the variables.

Pair Plot: A plot that displays pairwise relationships between variables in a dataset using scatter plots and histograms.

Pie Chart: A circular chart that displays the relative proportions of categories in a dataset, with each wedge representing a category and its size indicating its proportion.

Count Chart: A bar chart that displays the count or frequency of a categorical variable.

Point Plot: A plot that displays the mean or median of a numerical variable for each category of a categorical variable, along with the confidence interval.

Box Plot: A graphical representation of the distribution of a numerical variable using a box and whisker plot, where the box represents the interquartile range, and the whiskers represent the range of the data.

Line Plot: A plot that displays the relationship between two numerical variables using a line connecting the data points.

Swarm Plot: A plot that displays the distribution of a categorical variable with a numerical variable using points that are jittered to avoid overlap.

Heat Map: A plot that displays the relationship between two numerical variables using a color-coded grid, where each cell represents the joint frequency or density of the two variables.
