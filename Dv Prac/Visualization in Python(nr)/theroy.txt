Visualization in Python is typically done using packages such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library that provides a high degree of flexibility and control over visualizations. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and provides a range of statistical visualization functions. Plotly is a web-based visualization library that allows for the creation of interactive visualizations and dashboards. Python's syntax is easy to learn and understand, making it accessible for users with varying levels of programming experience. Additionally, Python's integration with data processing and analysis tools, such as pandas and numpy, makes it an ideal choice for creating data-driven visualizations
