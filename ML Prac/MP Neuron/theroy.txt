McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron is a simple model of a neuron proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. It takes binary inputs and produces a binary output based on a threshold function. The inputs are first weighted, and then summed up. If the sum is greater than or equal to a threshold value, the output is 1, otherwise, it is 0. MP neurons can be combined to form artificial neural networks, which can be used for simple pattern recognition and classification tasks. However, MP neurons have limitations, such as the inability to handle continuous inputs or learn from data, and have been replaced by more advanced models of artificial neurons.
