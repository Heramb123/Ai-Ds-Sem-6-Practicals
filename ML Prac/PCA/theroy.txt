PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, while preserving as much of the original variance as possible. PCA works by finding a new set of orthogonal variables, called principal components, which capture the most important patterns and variations in the data. These principal components are ranked based on their explained variance, and the ones with the highest explained variance are retained, while the ones with the lowest explained variance are discarded. The reduced dataset can then be used for further analysis or visualization. PCA is widely used in various fields, such as image processing, data compression, and data visualization.
