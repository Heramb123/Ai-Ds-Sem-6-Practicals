Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes, maximizing the margin between the closest data points from each class. SVMs can be used with different kernel functions, such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), to model complex nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the output variable. SVMs are widely used in various fields, including image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics
