Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. It consists of a single layer of artificial neurons, which take multiple inputs and produce a single output. The inputs are first weighted, and then summed up. The sum is passed through an activation function, which produces the output. The weights are updated based on the errors between the predicted and actual outputs, using a learning rule known as the perceptron learning rule.

Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training multi-layer artificial neural networks. It works by propagating the errors backwards from the output layer to the hidden layers, adjusting the weights and biases of each layer to minimize the errors. The algorithm uses a gradient descent approach to update the weights and biases, which involves calculating the derivative of the error with respect to each weight and bias. Backpropagation is widely used in various fields, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics
