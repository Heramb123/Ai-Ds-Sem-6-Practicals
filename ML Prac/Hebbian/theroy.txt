Hebbian Learning is a type of unsupervised learning in which the strength of connections between neurons is modified based on the correlation of their activities. It is based on the Hebbian principle, which states that "neurons that fire together, wire together." In other words, if two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the strength of their connection will increase, which can lead to the formation of new neural pathways and the development of new behaviors and skills. Hebbian Learning is used in various neural network models, such as self-organizing maps and autoencoders
