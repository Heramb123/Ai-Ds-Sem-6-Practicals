Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. It works by fitting a linear equation to the data, which can then be used to make predictions. There are two types of linear regression: simple linear regression, which involves only one input variable, and multiple linear regression, which involves two or more input variables. Simple linear regression is used when there is a linear relationship between the input and output variables, while multiple linear regression is used when there are multiple input variables that can affect the output variable.
